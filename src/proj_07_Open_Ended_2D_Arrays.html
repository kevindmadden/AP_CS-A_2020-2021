    <h1>Project #07 - Open Ended 2D Array Project</h1>
    <h2>Submission:</h2>
    Submit on <a href="https://codepost.io">codepost.io</a>.
    <h2>Description:</h2>
        Code something complex that requires you to make use of both 2D arrays and classes/objects in a substantial/meaningful manner. The game that you code needs to be at a level of complexity that will challenge you, but it also needs to be of a low enough level of complexity that you'll have time to finish it. This is why I'll be asking you to submit what you are planning to do in advance so that I can confirm your plan strikes the right balance in terms of overall complexity.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The game needs to make use of 2D arrays in a substantial/meaningful manner. In other words, there should be a clear need to use a 2D array.</li>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Here are example of games that would be too basic to earn a decent score:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Tic-tac-toe</li>
                <li>Checkers</li>
                <li>Anything that's a knock-off of Connect 4.</li>
                <li>Anything you could super easily write an AI to play a perfect game.</li>
                <li>Pong</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Here are examples of games one person couldn't finish coding in their lifetime:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Battlefield</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Here are examples of board games you could make:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Battleship</li>
                <li>Go</li>
                <li>Chess</li>
                <li>Reversi/Othello</li>
                <li>Chinese Checkers</li>
                <li>Stratego</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Here are video game examples of what you could make:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Minesweeper (???)</li>
                <li>Snake (need to add items/powerups)</li>
                <li>Tetris</li>
                <li>Pac-man</li>
                <li>2048</li>
                <li>A game you make up</li>
                <li>An enhanced version of an existing game that adds more complexity</li>
                <li>A simplified version of a tile-based combat game like Fire Emblem</li>
                <li>A dungeon crawler</li>
                <li>A very simplified version of a grid-based RPG (e.g., pokemon)</li>

            </ul>

        <li>Specific Coding Requirements</li>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>The game must make use of a 2D array in a meaningful manner.
            <li>The game must make heavy use of objects/classes in a meaningful manner.</li>
            <li>Your game needs to work. Code that errors out is an automatic 0.</li>
            <li>Your game needs to be fun to play.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose something to make that you really do want to make. If you are really interested in working on this, it will mostly feel fun to work on it rather than it feeling like homework.</li>
        <li>This will be the most complex project you have worked on thus far. Be especially careful that you always have your code indented correctly. Test your code frequently or it will become nearly impossible to debug your code.</li>
        <li>I'm happy to help. Please do be aware I'm not a super-human that can read all of the code you've written in 30 seconds and immediately find the bug you've been looking for. :)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>TBD</li>
    </ul>
