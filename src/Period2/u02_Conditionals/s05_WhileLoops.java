        Assignment:
            -Complete ALL 5.2 MPL exercises
            -Skip 21214
            -Exercises 21007 and 21009 require you to compare strings. When
            comparing strings, use .equals() instead of ==. The syntax works like
            this:
                String word1 = "hello"
                String word2 = "hello"
                String word3 = "bye"

            Here are a few examples:
                word1.equals(word2)  //this expression evaluates to true
                word1.equals("hello") //this expression evaluates to true
                word1.equals(word3) //this expression evaluates to false
                word1.equals("test") //this expression evaluates to false
                word1==word2 //DO NOT CHECK EQUALITY OF TWO STRINGS WITH ==
                word1==word3 //DO NOT CHECK EQUALITY OF TWO STRINGS WITH ==

         */

        //Two types of while loops: standard while loop, do while loop


    }
}
