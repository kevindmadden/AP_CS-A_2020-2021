        //Questions:
        // Where have we used a single ='s sign so far this year?
            // When assigning a value to a variable. (int x = 7;)
            // When changing a value of a variable (x = 9;)

        //Where have we seen expressions so far this year?
            // x/3
            // 7%3
            // 9*3.0

        //Boolean Expressions: An expression that evaluates to a boolean value.
            // boolean value - true or false
            // 3 > 5 (evaluates to false, because 3 is not greater than 5)
        System.out.println(3 > 5); //false
        System.out.println(3 < 5); //true
        System.out.println(8 <= 8); //true
        System.out.println(8 >= 8); //true
        System.out.println(5 == 5); //true
        System.out.println(5 != 5); //false

        //NOTICE: We used TWO ='s signs here. The reason is because a single ='s sign
        // it already means something! A single ='s sign means you are assigning a value to a variable.
        // So that poses a problem, how can we ask if two things are equal? Well, the solution is to use
        // two ='s signs.

        int x = 3; //this ='s sign means: assigning the value 3 to x
        System.out.println(5==7); //this ='s sign, we're asking if 5 equals 7
