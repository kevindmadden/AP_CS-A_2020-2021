<h1>Project #08 - Creature Inheritance</h1>
<h2>Submission:</h2>
I will check this assignment group by group during class. If you are absent during the time we work on this in class, then email me the files.
<h2>Description:</h2>
Code something complex that requires you to make use of inheritance in a meaningful manner. The animation we walked through in class with the Creature class and the InescapableCreature class (which extended the Creature class) is intended to be something you can use and build off of as a starting point. If you want to go down a completely different route and make use of inheritance in a different context, then check with me first before you start.
<h2>Timeline:</h2>
The ideal timeline is for you to finish coding your mini-project in exactly two full class periods. If you need to spillover into working on it for part of another class period, that is fine and class will be setup on the third day in such a way that you can continue working if you need it.
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Utilize inheritance in a meainingful manner.  ll out the survey for what you plan on doing for your project so that I can confirm you are doing something reasonable.</li>
    <li>The game you make needs to be complex (see later bullets for more examples of games you could and couldn't make for this assignment).</li>
    <li>The game needs to make use of 2D arrays in a meaningful manner.</li>
    <li>The game must make heavy use of objects/classes in a meaningful manner.</li>
    <li>By <em>meaningful</em> manner I mean that your use of 2D arrays/classes needs to actually be needed for your program and that it would be difficult to come up with another way to do it. For example, creating an empty 2D array and not using it doesn't work for meeting this requirement.</li>
    <li>Your game needs to work. Code that errors out is an automatic 0.</li>
    <li>Your game needs to be reasonably fun to play, at least for you. Otherwise, this will be a much more boring assignment for you.</li>
    <li>Here are example of games that would be too basic to earn any credit:
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Tic-tac-toe</li>
            <li>If it's a board game, then do not code it if you could give simple instructions to a computer to play in your place that would let you win reliably. Check with me if you're in doubt.</li>
            <li>A basic game of pong with no extra bells and whistles</li>
            <li>Checkers or Connect-4 (We coded these in 1st and 2nd periods respectively. Otherwise, these two games would be at a sufficient level of complexity for this assignment.)</li>
            <li>Anything you could super easily write an AI to play a perfect game.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The game should have some sort of extra bells and whistles added to it that make it unique and truly your own.</li>
    <li>Here are some examples of board games you could make:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Battleship</li>
        <li>Go</li>
        <li>Chess</li>
        <li>Reversi/Othello</li>
        <li>Chinese Checkers</li>
        <li>Stratego</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Here are video game examples of what you could make:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Snake (need to add items/powerups)</li>
        <li>Tetris</li>
        <li>Pac-man</li>
        <li>2048</li>
        <li>An enhanced version of an existing game that adds more complexity</li>
        <li>A <em>very</em> simplified version of a tile-based combat game like Fire Emblem</li>
        <li>A dungeon crawler</li>
        <li>A game you make up that is sufficiently complex (this is the most fun one to choose!)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Note that you should also avoid coding any game that one person could never feasibly code in an entire liftetime of work.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Choose something to make that you really do want to make. If you are really interested in working on this, it will mostly just feel fun to work on (as opposed to feeling like homework).</li>
    <li>This will be the most complex project you have worked on thus far. Be especially careful that you always have your code indented correctly. Test your code frequently or it will become nearly impossible to debug your code.</li>
    <li>I'm happy to help. Please do be aware I'm not a super-human that can read all of the code you've written in 30 seconds and immediately find the bug you've been looking for. :)</li>
