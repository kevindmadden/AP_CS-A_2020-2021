<h1>Project #08 - Creature Inheritance</h1>
<h2>Submission:</h2>
I will check this assignment group by group during class. If you are absent during the time we work on this in class, then email me the files.
<h2>Description:</h2>
Code something complex that requires you to make use of inheritance in a meaningful manner. The animation we walked through in class with the Creature class and the InescapableCreature class (which extended the Creature class) is intended to be something you can readily use and build off of as a starting point. If you want to go down a completely different route and make use of inheritance in a different context, then check with me first before you start.
<h2>Timeline:</h2>
The ideal timeline is for you to finish coding your mini-project is in exactly two full class periods. If you need to spillover into working on it for part of another class period, that is fine; class will be setup on the third day in such a way that you can continue working if you need it. If you have more than 10 minutes left when you finish on day 2, then add another small feature to your mini-project.
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Below is a list of the three things to make sure that you do in your code. You will likely use way more than just one of each of the things below, but you want to make sure you implement each of these three distinctly different concepts from the unit at least once in your final product:
        <ul>
            <li>Create at least one class that extends another class.</li>
            <li>Use <code>super(parameter1, parameter2, etc.)</code> at least once to call a constructor in the parent class.</li>
            <li>Use <code>super.insertMethodNameHere()</code> to call a method in the parent class.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Utilize inheritance in a meaningful manner.</li>
    <li>Similar to other assignments, I'm using the term "meaningful" as a way of giving you the freedom to exercise your creativity however you like in a manner that challenges you.</li>
    <li>A key difference between this assignment and previous assignments this school year is that in implementing inheritance, I'm <strong>not</strong> asking you to make use of inheritance to do something that you previously would have been unable to do without inheritance. As discussed in class, inheritance is <strong>an</strong> approach to writing code. So do not look for something to do that you wouldn't be able to do without inheritance. Instead, think of something that you already theoretically know how to do without inheritance but that you think would be easier to do with inheritance. This is incredibly subjective. So all I'm grading you on is if you choose to code what you think would be easier to do with inheritance. In other words, I'll take your word for it.</li>
    <li>As usual, code that errors out is an automatic 0. You'll need to revise it and show it to me again to receive credit.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If you chose something you thought would be easier with inheritance but it turned out it wasn't, that is totally fine. You learned something valuable. It might be that you just prefer functional programming to object-oriented programming. </li>
    <li>As usual, I'm happy to help you out as you are coding. Please continue to be aware I'm not a super-human that can read all of the code you've written in 30 seconds and immediately find the bug you've been looking for. :)</li>
</ul>
