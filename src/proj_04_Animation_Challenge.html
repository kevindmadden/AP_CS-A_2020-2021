<h1>Project #04 - Animation Challenge</h1>

</p>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Choose two animations from piazza that have been deemed "doable."</li>
    <li>Successfully implement these two animations.</li>
    <li>You must challenge yourself: For at least one of the animations that you implement, choose one of the doable options that you do not immediately see a way to do.</li>


</ol>
<h2>Some tips:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Break up the animations into simpler steps such that you are able to test each step along the way.</li>
    <li>Take breaks. Let your brain work through the problem while you aren't actively working on it.</li>
    <li>Ask for help when you need it. There's nothing to be ashamed of in asking for help. It likely just means that you are doing this assignment correctly.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Reminder:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The purpose of the assignment is to challenge yourself.</li>
</ul>
