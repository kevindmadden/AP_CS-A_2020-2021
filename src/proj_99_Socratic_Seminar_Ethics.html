<h1>Project #99 - Socratic Seminar on Ethics</h1>
<h2>Submission:</h2>
TBD
<h2>Description:</h2>
For a number of days in class, we will have a socratic seminar. These are the potential topics we will discuss as a class:
<ul>
    <li>Socrates' Defense Speech (https://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/103/Apol_Velasq_Tr.htm). It seems fitting for us to begin with for the first socratic seminar to start by discussing Socrates' famous speech that he gave just before his execution. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In terms of specific ways in which you code this assignment, I'm looking for the below three main items. You will likely more than just one of each item below, but please make sure you implement each item at least once in your final product:
        <ul>
            <li>Create at least one class that extends another class.</li>
            <li>Use <code>super(parameter1, parameter2, etc.)</code> at least once to call a constructor in the parent class.</li>
            <li>Use <code>super.insertMethodNameHere()</code> to call a method in the parent class.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Utilize inheritance in a meaningful manner.</li>
    <li>Similar to other assignments, I'm using the term "meaningful" as a way of giving you the freedom to exercise your creativity however you like in a manner that challenges you.</li>
    <li>A key difference between this assignment and previous assignments this school year is that in implementing inheritance, I'm <strong>not</strong> asking you to make use of inheritance to do something that you previously would have been unable to do without inheritance. As discussed in class, inheritance is <strong>an</strong> approach to writing code. So do not look for something to do that you wouldn't be able to do without inheritance. Instead, think of something that you already theoretically know how to do without inheritance but that you think would be easier to do with inheritance. This is incredibly subjective. So all I'm grading you on is if you choose to code what you think would be easier to do with inheritance. In other words, I'll take your word for it.</li>
    <li>As usual, code that errors out is an automatic 0. You'll need to revise it and show it to me again to receive credit.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If you chose something you thought would be easier with inheritance but it turned out it wasn't, that is totally fine. You learned something valuable. It might be that you just prefer functional programming to object-oriented programming. </li>
    <li>As usual, I'm happy to help you out as you are coding. Please continue to be aware I'm not a super-human that can read all of the code you've written in 30 seconds and immediately find the bug you've been looking for. :)</li>
</ul>
