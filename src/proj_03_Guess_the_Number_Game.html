    <h1>Project #03 - Guess the Number Game</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
        Create a game in which the computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 inclusive. Then the computer asks the user to guess what the correct number is. Whenever the user's guess is incorrect, the computer tells the player whether their guess was too low or too high, and then the computer asks the user to enter their next guess. Whenever the user guesses the correct number, the computer should ask the user whether they want to play again. If yes, then a new random number should be generated, and the user should go back to making guesses. If the user does not wish to play again, then the program should end.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use Math.random() in order to generate the random number the user is trying to guess.</li>
        <li>You must use at least one do-while loop in your code in a substantive manner.</li>
        <li>You must use at least one normal while loop in your code in a substantive manner.</li>
        <li>When the user is asked whether they wish to play again, they should enter capital <code>Y</code> to play again or capital <code>N</code> to quit. If the user enters any other character(s), assume that the user does not wish to play again.</li>
        <li>If the user does not wish to play again, the program itself needs to stop running completely.</li>

    </ol>
    <h2>Some tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Write your code initially so that it does not give the user the option to play again. Just assume that the player never wants to play again. Then once everything else about the program is working completely correctly, start coding in an option that allows the user to play again.</li>
        <li>Test your code frequently as you work. Do not try to write out all the code for the program at once because if you then have errors in your code, it will be very hard to troubleshoot.</li>
        <li>When you are testing out your code, it may be helpful to temporarily print out the random number that the computer chose. In some cases, this may help speed up the debugging process for you.</li>
        <li>Use a do-while loop in order to repeatedly give the user chances to guess the number. The do-while loop's condition should have something to do with whether or not the user guessed the correct number.</li>
        <li>Use a normal while loop in order to control what happens if the user wishes to play again. My advice would be to create a boolean variable called <code>shouldKeepPlaying</code> that is set to true by default. Once a game finishes, the user's input should determine the new value for <code>shouldKeepPlaying</code>.</li>
        <li>If using the two types of while loops in the manner specified above, the entire do-while loop will be nested somewhere in the normal while loop. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reminder:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The purpose of the assignment is for you to become comfortable using methods. Please ask questions as they arise. I do realize that this is the first time many of you are writing a more complex program like this one.</li>
    </ul>
